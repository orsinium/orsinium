## Hi, I'm Gram 👋

I do a lot of OSS, mostly on 🐍 Python and 🏃 Go. I like to experiment with different technologies and ideas.

Some highlights:

+ 📏 [textdistance](https://github.com/life4/textdistance): 2.9k+ stars. 40+ algorithms for calculating the distance between given sequences. Most of the algorithms contain original research and optimizations done by me.
+ 🔥 [dephell](https://github.com/dephell/dephell): 1.7k+ stars, archived. I tried to fix Python packaging. It went pretty well but it's hard to maintain such a huge project alone.
+ 📄 [deal](https://github.com/life4/deal): 400+ stars but still very cool project. The project brings formal verification, design by contract, Hoare logic, and other powerful ideas into Python to empower you to write bug-free code.
+ [gweb](https://github.com/life4/gweb): 180+ stars but also cool. Brings WebAPI into WASM-compiled Go code, must-have for writing JS-free frontend.

See also 🍴 [forks](https://github.com/orsinium/forks) for maintained forks of my archived projects.

I don't want to claim my ownership on the things I make. Quite the opposite, I try to make it part of the bigger community. So, all my projects are in different organizations:

+ 😎 [life4](https://github.com/life4): cool and important projects I maintain.
+ 🔬 [orsinium-labs](https://github.com/orsinium-labs): small projects that don't need much maintenance.
+ 💾 [orsinium-archive](https://github.com/orsinium-archive): projects that are still cool but will never get new changes.
+ 🔥 [dephell](https://github.com/dephell): dephell ecosystem, mostly libraries related to Python packaging.
+ 🍴 [orsinium-forks](https://github.com/orsinium-forks): ignore this one.

❤️ [Support my work](https://github.com/sponsors/orsinium) if any of my projects saved your day.

It's hard to list here all my work. I have over 100 original open-source projects and numerous contributions. Read more at 🧠 [orsinium.dev](https://orsinium.dev/).
