## Hi, I'm Gram

I do a lot of OSS, mostly on Python and Go. I like to experiment with different technologies and ideas.

Some highlights:

+ [textdistance](https://github.com/life4/textdistance): 2.6k+ stars. 40+ algorithms for calculating the distance between given sequences. Most of the algorithms contain original research and optimizations done by me.
+ [dephell](https://github.com/dephell/dephell): 1.7k+ stars, archived. I tried to fix Python packaging. It went pretty well but it's hard to make such a huge project alone.
+ [deal](https://github.com/life4/deal) (270 stars but still very cool project)

See also [forks](https://github.com/orsinium/forks) for maintained forks of my archived projects.

I don't want to claim my ownership on the things I make. Quite the opposite, I try to make it part of the bigger community. So, all my projects are in different organizations:

+ [life4](https://github.com/life4): cool and important projects I maintain.
+ [orsinium-labs](https://github.com/orsinium-labs): small projects that don't need much maintenance.
+ [orsinium-archive](https://github.com/orsinium-archive): projects that are still cool but will never get new changes.
+ [dephell](https://github.com/dephell): dephell ecosystem, mostly libraries related to Python packaging.
+ [orsinium-forks](https://github.com/orsinium-archive): ignore this one.
